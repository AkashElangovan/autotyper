# Auto Typer Application with Custom Speed and Ctrl+Number Triggers

This Python-based auto typer application allows you to simulate typing with a custom speed. You can assign specific trigger keys using `Ctrl` + any number (0-9) to start or stop typing the assigned text. The application is equipped with a graphical user interface (GUI) to make it easy to add multiple auto-typing instances.

## Features

- **Custom Typing Speed**: Set typing speed in Words Per Minute (WPM).
- **Ctrl+Number Triggers**: Trigger keys are combinations of `Ctrl` + a number (0-9).
- **Supports Multiple Instances**: You can run multiple auto-typing instances with different trigger keys.
- **Preserves Indentation**: The text you paste into the text box preserves its original formatting and indentation.
- **Stop Typing with Same Key**: Pressing the same trigger key will stop the auto-typing.
